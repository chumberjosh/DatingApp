Section 1 - What we're going to do
  1. Introduction

Section 2 - Checking functionality and prepaing the development environment
  1. Walking Skeleton (create a small chunk of the program to test functionality)
     Creating the application arcitechture
	- Database
	- ORM (entity framework)
	- API (This fetches the information to be displayed on the SPA)
	- SPA (Angular Application)
  2. Creating the web API Project - 
  3. Review the default files created by the DotNetCLI - the tool we're going to be using to create the web api
  4. Ensure the web API runs successfully
  5. Create our database using the Code first approach
  6. Add source control -  to check in the changes
  7. Create the Angular Application
  8. Make HTTP requests from angular to fetch data from our API - configure the application to fetch data from the API
  9. Bind data from the API to the HTML to display it on the page
  10. Add support for Bootstrap and Font Awesome - so we can make the styling easier

Section 3 - The database
  1. How we store passwords in the database
  2. Creating the User Model - adding new migrations
  3. The repository pattern - why we should use it
  4. Creating the authenticaion controller
  5. Data transfer objects
  6. Token authentication - when a user logs in we dont want them to keep having to log in when they go and come back in a short amount of time
  7. Authentication Middleware - use it to protect our controllers and the methods inside them

Section 4 - Creating the webpage
  1. Creating Login and Navbar
  2. Angular Template Forms - how angular handles forms
  3. Usings services in Angular - how we use our own servies in angular, we dont want to put all the methods scattered around the API, we want them all in one place and then
inject them in
  4. Conditionally displaying elements on a page - display certain information based on ceratin things
  5. Create a register component - so users can register
  6. Component communication - the components are going to need to communicate to eachother, the child component -> parent component and vice versa

Section 5 - Errors and exceptions
  1. Handling exceptions in the API
  2. Setting up the Global exception Handler in the API
  3. Handling errors in Angular

Section 6 - Optimising the webpage for the user
   1. Alertifyjs - provide notifications to the user (a better way of telling the user that there is an error than putting it in the console)
	We used the 'npm install function to install alertify'
	Alertifyjs was then added to the node_modules
	We added the "node_modules/alertifyjs/build/alertify.min.js" into angular.json inside a script
	We then imported alertify into styles.css
	We then generated a service called alertify in the '-SPA >src >app >services' folder (this created 2 .ts files) 
	View 'alertify.service.ts' to see what was done inside this	
	Added 'AlertifyService' as a provider inside 'app.module.ts'
	Made sure that 'Alertifyservice' is imported at the top of 'app.module.ts'		(import { AlertifyService } from './_services/alertify.service';)
	We added the alertify service to the 'nav.component.ts' - check the file to see what has been done
	We also add it to register.componenet.ts

   2. Angular JWT (lec 55 and 56) - This just checks that a token actually exists and if it has expired
	This is the one we use - https://github.com/auth0/angular2-jwt
	View section 6, lecture 55 and 56 on how to do this
	We then make the 'welcome user' on the top right say 'welcome [users name]
	We then change the code so it will last through a refresh because otherwise the name would disappear after a page refresh

   3. NGX Bootstrap - We're using NGX Bootstrap because it provides similar functionality to Bootstrap JS but we're not using Bootstrap because that needs jQuery which
we're not using
	Watch Lecture 56, here we made it so the dropdown menu where it says 'welcome [user] works
	We also did some more conditional rendering so the buttons only show when a user is logged in

   4. Bootswatch - This will allow us to change the theme to the site (colours, look and feel)
	Watch Lecture 57 on how to import this and how to edit it so you can customise it and make it look however you want it to look

Section 7 - Routing in Angular - Why we need routing? We need Routing because we're creating a Single Page Application, this means we're not going to different pages and
routing allows us to find and load different parts of the application without having to reload the page. It will still change the URL even though we're on the same page
   1. Setting up routing
	. 
   2. Use RouterLinkActinve - we can make our links our pages look like they're the active page that is being loaded
	. 
   3. Using Routing in Code - Navigate users from one part of the application to another without adding links into our html
	. 
   4. Protecting the routes - We're going to have a lot of user information so we dont want to give full access to anonymous users
	.
   5. Protecting multiple routes at once - with one route guard
